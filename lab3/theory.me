Abstract Stack Class (Stack):

This class defines the basic operations that any stack should support: push, pop, peek, is_empty, and size.
ListStack Implementation (ListStack):

This implementation uses a Python list (self.elements) to store elements.
push: Appends an element to the end of the list.
pop: Removes and returns the last element from the list.
peek: Returns the last element without removing it.
is_empty: Checks if the list is empty.
size: Returns the number of elements in the list.
LinkedStack Implementation (LinkedStack):

This implementation uses a linked list to store elements.
push: Adds a new element to the top of the stack (linked list).
pop: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
peek: Returns the element from the top without removing it.
is_empty: Checks if the stack is empty.
size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
DynamicArrayStack Implementation (DynamicArrayStack):

This implementation uses a dynamic array (Python list) with a specified initial capacity.
push: Adds an element to the array, and if the array is full, it doubles its capacity.
pop: Removes and returns the last element from the array.
peek: Returns the last element without removing it.
is_empty: Checks if the array is empty.
size: Returns the number of elements in the array.
